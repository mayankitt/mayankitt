Hi there üëã I'm Mayank Choudhary
================================

### Full-Stack Architect | Scrum Master | AI Enthusiast

> "I don't just write code; I architect systems that keep global operations running smoothly. Whether it's optimizing flight services ‚úàÔ∏è, managing network traffic üåê, or streamlining manufacturing logistics, my focus is on delivering resilient, high-impact software solutions."

üöÄ The Core of What I Build
---------------------------

I'm a seasoned Senior Software Engineer with a deep background in Full-Stack development, spanning roles at major global players like **Emirates**, **Cisco**, and **Siemens**. My strength lies in bridging the gap between complex business needs and robust, scalable technology.

## Skill Focus
**Backend & Services**

Java (Spring Boot), Python (Flask), NestJS

Designing and deploying microservices using a variety of strategies, from simple ones like Blue/Green to state of the art with containerization and orchestration solutions like **Docker / Kubernetes**. Handling high-volume data with **Oracle**, **PostgreSQL** **Couchbase**, **Solace** and many more.

**Frontend Magic**

Angular, React, Typescript, Bootstrap

Driving the transition of large-scale applications (like the one at Emirates) from Angular to React for modern, high-performance UIs.

**DevOps & Cloud**

Kubernetes, Docker, AWS (API Gateway, Cloudwatch)

Architecting solutions for 24/7 availability and managing deployments for mission-critical systems (e.g., Cisco's Crosswork Optimization Engine).

**Agile Leadership**

Wearing multiple hats, from Product Owner to Scrum Master, and mentoring teams to adopt an Agile-First approach to product delivery.

üí° Always Strategizing for Tomorrow
-----------------------------------

My technical journey is guided by a focus on **long-term financial security** and leveraging AI. My current passion projects revolve around:

1.  **AI & Future-Proofing:** Actively strategizing on how to pivot toward foundational sectors like **Renewable Energy** and **AI Infrastructure** where automation expertise will be indispensable.
    
2.  **System Resiliency:** Exploring advanced MLOps and data engineering pipelines to ensure AI models are deployed reliably and at scale.
    
3.  **Cross-Domain Solutions:** Taking proven architectural patterns from multiple domains (microservices, real-time data) and applying them to new industries (like smart logistics and manufacturing).
    

üèÜ Recognitions & Fun Facts
---------------------------

*   Awards at Emirates for contributions to cutting-edge crew applications.
    
*   Awards at Siemens for contributions in knowledge management solutions.
    
*   I actively enjoy **singing** üé§ and am always looking for **solution-centric socio-economic discussions**.
    
*   **Hobbies:** Strategizing the leverage of AI, participating in debates, and learning new tech!
